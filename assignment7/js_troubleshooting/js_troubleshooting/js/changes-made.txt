<script type="text/javascript" src="/slider.js"></script> 

correct :         <script type="text/javascript" src="js/slider.js"></script>

In HTML file the js file path was incorrect - added the correct file path
also changed the script tag to end of the body for a better loading the page.

---

document.getElementsById("img").src = "./images" + a[selectedIndex]; 

The getElementById() is mistyped and the id of image is "imgs" not "img"
Used Template literals for the strings because it was recommended by eslint
A "/" was missing in the path for the image

---

  if (type === 0) {
    selectedIndex--;
  } else selectedIndex++;

Here the type is not string but in the argument passed through html page onclick function was a string
Here the unary operators are changed because it was not recommended by eslint

---

  if (selectedIndex <= 0) {
    selectedIndex = a.length - 1;
  } else if (selectedIndex >= a.length) {
    selectedIndex = 0;
  }

  correct code: 
  
    if (selectedIndex < 0) {
        selectedIndex = a.length - 1;
    } else if (selectedIndex >= a.length) {
        selectedIndex = 0;
    }

  Here the condition checks if selectedIndex is 0 then the first image wont be shown because the index of first image is 0, So removed the =

line 1: let a = ["1.jpg", "2.jpg", "3.jpg"]; // In this first line double quotes are used so changed it to single quotes.

line 2: const selectedIndex = 0; // const is changed to let because we a reassigning values to it

line 6: selectedIndex--; // changed to selectedIndex -= 1; unary operators are not recommended in eslint rules
line 7: did the same for selectedIndex++;
